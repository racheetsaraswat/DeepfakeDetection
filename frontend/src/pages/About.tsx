				<h1>About this project</h1>
				<p>
					This Major Project explores <strong>deepfake detection</strong> — the task of identifying AI‑generated
					or manipulated media. Our goal is to give users an educational, hands‑on way to see how a detector
					model behaves on real images and videos.
				</p>
				<p>
					The system is built with <strong>FastAPI</strong> for the backend, <strong>MongoDB</strong> for
					persistent storage, <strong>Celery</strong> for background processing, and a lightweight{" "}
					<strong>PyTorch</strong> model for deepfake scoring. A TypeScript + React frontend ties everything
					together in a clean UI.
				</p>
				<p>
					This demo is <strong>not</strong> a production‑grade forensic tool. It is intended for learning,
					experimentation, and as a foundation that can be extended with stronger models, better datasets,
					and more advanced visualizations.
				</p>
